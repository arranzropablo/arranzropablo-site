  My name is Pablo Arranz Ropero and I'm a junior backend developer @ Zooplus. 
  
  Besides backend, I also enjoy learning about CI/CD and operational tools such as <mark>K8s</mark>, <mark>Docker</mark>, <mark>ELK</mark>... among others.
  
  Although I barely started my career I consider myself a truly capable programmer led by my effort and my endless wish of knowledge.

  My best programming skill is <mark>Java</mark> and I'm currently interested on learning <mark>Go</mark>
